## Project Setup
### Initial Setup
Before getting started... please run `npm install -g yarn` (or if on macOS or Linux make sure to run it with `sudo`)
1. Run `yarn install` / `yarn` (however, its possible `npm install` would work, but I wouldn't recommend it. - Jullian)
### Running the server
So, there really isn't much for server running, here are the steps:
1. Run `yarn start:dev` (or `npm run start:dev` if you don't want to use `yarn`)
